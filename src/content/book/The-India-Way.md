## Introduction

In "The India Way," S. Jaishankar, India's External Affairs Minister, presents a compelling vision of India's foreign policy and strategic autonomy in a rapidly changing global landscape. As someone interested in international relations, I found this book to be an enlightening read that offers a unique perspective from someone who has been at the forefront of India's diplomatic engagements.

In the book, Jaishankar discusses India's foreign policy and strategic autonomy in a rapidly changing global landscape. He also discusses India's role in the Indo-Pacific region, India's relationship with the US and Europe, India's relationship with China, and India's relationship with other countries. The book also discusses India's economic diplomacy, regional diplomacy, multilateralism and global governance, and security challenges.

### Chapter 1 : The Lessons of Awadh

#### The Dangers of strategic Complacency

The book begins with an insightful analysis of how India navigates complex international relations. I particularly appreciated Jaishankar's explanation of how India balances its relationships with major powers while maintaining strategic independence. In here the book describes the equation of power and how it is changing in the world along with the shift in power in last few decades.

### Chapter 2 : The Art of Disruption

#### The United States in a Flatter World

In this chapter the author describes the changing world order and how the US is trying to maintain its hegemony in the world. The author also describes the changing dynamics of the US-China relationship and how it is affecting the world order. The author also describes the need of India to engage in border set of partners more creatively.

### Chapter 3 : Krishna's Choice

### Chapter 4 : The Dogmas of Delhi

#### Overcoming the Hesitations of History

The author's reflections on India's evolving relationship with the US and European nations were thought-provoking. I appreciated his balanced view on the benefits of closer ties with the West while maintaining India's strategic autonomy. The author also describes the changing structure of international order. Author talks about avoiding obsession about consistency because it makes a little sense in such a dynamic world.

### Chapter 5 : Of Mandarins and Masses

#### Public Opinion and The West

This chapter examines India's regional relationships in detail. Jaishankar's analysis of India's approach to its immediate neighbors and the broader South Asian region provides valuable insights into the country's neighborhood policy. The Indo-American relationship is at the heart of the overall approach to the west.

### Chapter 6 : The Nimzo-Indian Defence

#### Managing China's Rise

The discussion on how rising nationalism affects diplomatic engagements was particularly relevant in today's context. I found the author's analysis of how India must adapt to this shift while asserting its national interests to be compelling. This mainly talks about relationship with China and how India should manage it.

### Chapter 7 : A Delayed Destiny

#### India, Japan and the Asian Balance

This chapter talks about the relationship between India and China. The author also describes different aspects of the relationship between India and China. The role of India in how it can handle the relationship with China is also discussed in this chapter along with the role of Japan in the region. This chapter also talks about the inportance of our relationship with Japan.

## Overall Analysis
