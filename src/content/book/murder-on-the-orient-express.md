A Book Review of "Murder on the Orient Express"

This is my first book from the Author, and it did not disappoint me.

The book is a murder mystery and suspense. The book begins with a straightforward setup of the scene, progressing through the introduction of all the characters and the situation, followed by the murder and subsequent investigation.

The book is divided into mainly four sections.

**Initial scene setup and Character Introductions**

The book starts with a basic introduction to the characters involved in the story. This sets the whole basis for the novel. This sets the plot and the scene in terms of the location. The scene seems to be from the older times.

While doing the setup, there are elements introduced for the reader to guess the murders till the end of the book.

**Murder on the train**

Once on the train, the murder happens, and the murder does not have any dramatic representation in terms of the struggle. Along with the murder, the train is also stuck in the snow. So no one leaves the train, and no new passenger gets into the train. This makes the novel more interesting.

**Investigation**

Now the main character of the book called "**Hercule Poirot**" starts the investigation. There was a doctor and another to help him in the investigation. One by one, every passenger is questioned. After each passenger's statement, the mystery becomes increasingly confusing. Not adding more details to avoid revealing suspense. ;)

**Conclusion**

At the end the **Hercule Poirot** gets to the bottom of the whole Mystery. He was able to see the minute details about all the passengers' statements. Along with that, he also saw the whole setup from a completely different perspective and finally solved the mystery.

This book is definitely a good read for anyone who loves murder mysteries.
