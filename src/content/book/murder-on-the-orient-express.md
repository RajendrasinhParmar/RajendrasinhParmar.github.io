A Book Review of "Murder on the Orient Express"

This is my first book from the Author and it did not disappoint me.

The books is a murder mystery and suspense. The book start with simple setup of the scene, progresses through the setup of all the characters and the situation followed by the murder and investigation.

The book is divided in mainly four sections.

**Initial scene setup and Character Introductions**

The book starts with the basic introduction to the characters involved in the story. This sets the whole bases for the novel. This sets the plot and the scene in terms of the location. The scene seems to be of the older times.

While doing the setup there are element introduced for the reader to guess the murders till the end of the book.

**Murder on the train**

Once on the train the murder happens and the murder does not have any dramatic representation as in terms of the struggle. Along with the murder the train also is stuck in snow. So no one leave the train and no new passenger gets into the train. This makes the novel more interesting.

**Investigation**

Now the main character of the book called "**Hercule Poirot**" starts the investigation. there was a doctor and another to help him in the investigation. One by one every passenger is questioned. After each and every passengers statements the mystery gets more and more confusing. Not adding more details to avoid revealing suspense. ;)

**Conclusion**

At the end the **Hercule Poirot** gets to the bottom of the whole Mystery. He was able to see the minute details about all the passengers' statements. Along with that he also did see the whole setup in completely a different perspective and finally solved the mystery.

This book is definitely a good read for anyone who loves murder mystery.
