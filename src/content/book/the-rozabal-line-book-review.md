A Book Review of "The Rozabal Line"

Ashwin Sanghi's "The Rozabal Line" is a great read in historical fiction section. The book starts with multiple disconnected scenes and gradually they get connected through out the story.

This is a very fast paced novel that blends history, myth and conspiracy. Sanghi has done a very good job in weaving religion, history and political intrigue. The story also spans continent and centuries
Quotes from the book

> Life Puts us in situations so that we can learn from them. Once we have learned, it's time to throw away the guilt and move on
