A Book Review of "The Midnight Library"

In the initial read the books sets the stage for the story further. It's written about a women who commits suicide. It is due to all the failure's that she had in life.

She kept going for so many years with all the failures and bad luck in life. At the end she commits suicide due to yet another failure.

Now the story actually starts from right after that. She is in a place that is known as "The Midnight Library". There is a line in the book the i liked that goes like this "_Between life and death there is a library_".

The library contains infinite number of books and every single books is a variation of her own life. every single book in here was shades of green. among all this books there was only one book with Gray colour called a book of regrets.

The book was very heavy when she picked it up on suggestion from Mrs Elm the librarian. She flipped through all the pages from start to end. They were actually regrets starting from her childhood to the last day when she decided to end her life. She got overwhelmed while going through the book and closed it.

Mrs Elm asked her to try and think of the regret that she want to change and with this Mrs Elm will give her a book that is according the regret that she want to reverse.

She tried so many different life, all she understood was that any life that she choose, there will be struggle and different kinds of variation of life.

Now she want to actually live the root life from which the whole this came in to the being. When she came back to life, the whole perception has changed and now she is noticing the small things in her life.

### **Review to Post**

The overall theme of book is amazing and the concept is quite different in terms of understanding of human psychology. This book takes a very simple concept to try and explain a very deep self help concept.

This can definitely help one with a new perspective towards life. How you can see things that you take for granted or ignore them because they are very insignificant.

And finally few quotes from the book

> _It's not what you look at that matters, It's what you see._

> _The only way to learn is to live_

> You donâ€™t have to understand life. You just have to live it.
